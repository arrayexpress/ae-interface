                diabetes in mouse", you will need to use some search filters to limit the search space of your keywords,
                e.g. where "diabetes" is the subject of investigation, and not merely mentioned in background
                information of a study. Please refer to the <a href="how_to_search.html#AdvancedSearchExperiment">advanced

            <li><a id="private_access"></a><strong>Will I have full access to an experiment while it is private in

                Yes, if the experiment is a microarray study. You can view the ArrayExpress record and download all
                associated files if you <a href="how_to_search_private_data.html">log in to ArrayExpress with a
                    data-access account</a>.<br>

                <p>No, if the experiment is a sequencing study. When you <a href="how_to_search_private_data.html"> log
                    in to ArrayExpress</a>, you will be able to see the full ArrayExpress record, and download processed
                    data files, but the links to raw read data files (in fastq format) are placeholders until the
                    experiment is made public. The reason is that raw data files are brokered to the <a href="/ena">European
                        Nucleotide Archive (ENA)</a>, which is part of the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), a collaboration
                    between ENA (EBI), Genbank (NCBI), and DDBJ (Japan). There is currently no infrastructure to access
                    privately held data files in SRA.</p>

                example, to retrieve information about experiment E-MTAB-4567, use this
                link: <a href="/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-1730">https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-1730</a>.

        <h5>Other general questions</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><a id="ae_geo_overlap"></a><strong>How much overlap is there between ArrayExpress and the NCBI Gene
                Expression Omnibus (GEO)?</strong><br>
                ArrayExpress used to import data on a weekly basis from <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/"> NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)</a>, until autumn 2017. All experiments imported from GEO
                have accession numbers in the format of E-GEOD-n, where n is a number.
                For example, GEO accession "GSE29080" would become "E-GEOD-29080" in
                ArrayExpress. As of 1 Oct 2019, ArrayExpress contains 59357 GEO series (experiments),
                that is about 50% of the 118820 public series available in GEO on the same day.
                GEO currently does not mirror ArrayExpress experiments systematically.
                See the <a href="GEO_data.html">GEO data import page</a> for more details.

        </ul>

        <ul>
            <li><a id="cite"></a><strong>How do I cite my ArrayExpress data sets in my publication?</strong><br>
                <p>You should include your experiment accession number and the URL to
                    ArrayExpress home page, <a href="/arrayexpress/">www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</a>.
                    e.g. "RNA-seq data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database at EMBL-EBI (<a
                            href="/arrayexpress/">www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress</a>)under accession number E-MTAB-xxxx."
                    You can also include a direct link to your experiment or array design. For example, the link would
                    be
                    <code>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/experiments/E-MTAB-1234</code> for experiment
                    "E-MTAB-1234", or
                    <code>https://www.ebi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/arrays/A-MTAB-567</code> for array design "A-MTAB-567".</p>
                <p>If you wish to include a citation
                    for the ArrayExpress database, then the following publication should be used: Athar A. et al., 2019. ArrayExpress update - from bulk to single-cell expression data. Nucleic

                an accession number?</strong><p>
                On average, within 30 minutes. It all depends on the size of your data files, and how busy we are with
                submissions on a given day. Normally, you should receive an automated email with the accession number
                within 5 minutes (small microarray experiment) or up to 24 hours (large sequencing experiment). Please
                email us at <a href="mailto:annotare@ebi.ac.uk">annotare@ebi.ac.uk</a> , citing your experiment's title,
                if the automated email has not come through after a prolonged wait.</p>

        <h5>Keeping unpublished data private</h5>
        <ul>
            <li><a id="keep_private"></a>
                <strong>Can my data be kept private after I submit it?</strong><br>
                Yes, all submitted information will be kept private
                until the release date that you set at the time of submission, or until
                a publication is released that contains the ArrayExpress accession
                number relating to your data. You can also change the release date to suit the
                peer review progress of your paper. Please see our <a href="data_availability.html#changes">data
                    availability</a>
                page for more information.

            <li><a id="journal_private_access"></a>
                <strong>The journal I am submitting to has requested private access to my data - how do I get
                    an ArrayExpress login for them?</strong><br>
                Firstly, start your <a href="/arrayexpress/submit/overview.html">ArrayExpress submission</a> if you have
                not already
                done so! You will be sent login details for viewing your private experimental data
                on the <a href="/arrayexpress">ArrayExpress website</a>
                <em>only when curation is finished and when your data is loaded into the ArrayExpress database</em>. If
                you are really pushed
                for time and are struggling with your ArrayExpres submission, <a href="mailto:annotare@ebi.ac.uk">let us
                    know</a> and we will try our best to help.

        <ul>
            <li><a id="double_blind"></a>
                <strong>The journal I am submitting to supports "double-blind" peer review. Can ArrayExpress hide my
                    name and contact details from the reviewers?</strong><br>
                Yes. If you're submitting a new data set via <a href="/fg/annotare/login">Annotare</a>, simply check the
                <code>Hide my identity from reviewers</code> box on the <code>Experiment Description</code> page. Please
                see <a href="/fg/annotare/help/describe_exp.html#remain_anonymous">submitter's guide on anonymity</a>
                for more information.<br>
                If you are the submitter of a previously non-anonymised private data set in ArrayExpress and would like
                to switch on anonymity, please write to us at <a href="mailto:arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk">arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk</a>.

                <strong>I tried to login to ArrayExpress to see some recently
                    submitted private data but it said my
                    username and password were invalid. Why?</strong><br>
                Possibly you have tried to login with your submitter account with our submission tools, such as <a
                        href="/fg/annotare/login">Annotare</a>?
                These "submitter" accounts can only be used for
                submitting data, not viewing it in ArrayExpress. We will provide you
                with an ArrayExpress data access login account after your submission has been
                curated and loaded into ArrayExpress.
                <p>If you are using an
                    ArrayExpress login which you have just received, it might not be
                    working yet because ArrayExpress is updated only once a day at about
                    6am UK time. Try again after this time.</p>
                <p>If you've forgotten or lost
                    your access account details, you can retrieve it using the
                    <a href="how_to_search_private_data.html#LostPrivateDataLogin">forgotten password tool</a>. If it
                    still does not work, contact

                    and tell us what login details you are trying to use / which page you

                Enter an estimated public release date up to 1
                year in the future from the day of submission. The release date can be changed during/after curation for
                multiple times to match the peer-review progress. Avoid setting release date at public holidays (e.g.
                Christmas/New Year period) to avoid inadvertent release of your data. Please see our <a

        <h5>What data files to submit</h5>

        <ul>
            <li><a id="data_file"></a>
                <strong>Which data files do I need to submit for an experiment?</strong><br>
                The files required depend on the technology (e.g. microarray vs sequencing) and also the biological
                context of the study
                (e.g. single-cell RNA-seq requires some extra files). Please refer to <a
                        href="/arrayexpress/submit/overview.html">the submission overview page</a>, which will guide you
                through the different scenarios.

            <li><strong><a id="mageml"></a>I have MAGE-ML/MAGE-TAB files generated from in-house pipelines. Does
                ArrayExpress
                still accept them?</strong><p>
                MAGE-ML files are no longer supported or accepted by ArrayExpress since 2011. MAGE-TAB spreadsheets,
                provided they are correctly formatted and <a href="ftp_upload.html">uploaded via FTP</a>, are still
                accepted in some exceptional cases under prior agreement with some submitters.</p>
                <p>The easiest way to submit data is to use our latest submission tool <a href="/fg/annotare/login">Annotare</a>,
                    which will generate MAGE-TAB files for you, so you don't have to worry about learning the file
                    format. All you need to do is to fill in a series of webforms and upload data files within the tool.
                    Annotare also has a built-in validator to save you writing validators/parsers to check your
                    submission.</p>
                <p>If you would like to update your pipeline to generate MAGE-TAB files, please write to us at <a
