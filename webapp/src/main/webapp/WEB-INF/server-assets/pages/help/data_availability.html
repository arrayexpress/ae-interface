        <a id="general"><h3>1. General information</h3></a>
        <p>Experiments (sets of assays) and array designs in
            ArrayExpress are either 'public' or 'private' (often pre-publication and under peer review). Data
            will be kept private until a specified release date, or until an associated
            paper containing the experiment or array design accession number is
            published. Access to private data is possible via <a href="#user_accounts">submitter and
            reviewer login accounts</a> created by ArrayExpress upon successful loading of an experiment or array design into the database.</p>
            
        <p>For sensitive data from human samples and individuals that can potentially lead to the identification of the donors (e.g. genomic DNA sequences), ArrayExpress 'private' data sets and submitter/reviewer login accounts cannot provide the high level of data encryption and access control required. In such cases, there should be a <a href="/ega/submission/FAQ#DAC">data access committee</a> overlooking data privacy issues, and the data should be submitted to the <a href="/ega/">European Genome-phenome Archive</a> (EGA).</p>
        <p>Human-identifiable data can still be submitted to ArrayExpress if the data has been consented for public release. Such approvals typically would be given by the relevant ethics committees and <em>ensuring this is the responsibility of the submitters</em>.</p>

        <a id="release"><h3>2. Release policy</h3></a>
        <p>Experiments are made public when</p>
        <ul>
            <li>the specified release date is reached</li>
            <li>the submitter emails to tell us that the data can now be
                released (usually this is when an associated publication is accepted or
                published)</li>
            <li>we identify a publication in which the ArrayExpress
                experiment accession number is cited</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Array designs are made public when </p>
        <ul>
            <li>the specified release date is reached </li>
            <li>the submitter emails to tell us that the data can now be
                released</li>
            <li>when an experiment the array design is linked to is made
                public</li>
            <li>we identify a publication in which the ArrayExpress array
                design accession number is cited </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When an experiment or array design is made public the data is
            available through the <a href="/arrayexpress">ArrayExpress web interface
            </a>and the <a href="ftp://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/microarray/">FTP site</a>.
            There are more information on this <a href="ftp_archives.html">ArrayExpress FTP downloads</a> help page.</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" class="linktotop">Top</a></p>

        <a id="changes"><h3>3. Release date changes</h3></a>
        <p>Reminders about experiment and array design release dates are sent to submitters 7, 30 and 60 days before the current release date.</p>
        <p><strong>Microarray experiment submitters:</strong> Release date can be changed using this <a href="https://www.ebi.ac.uk/fg/acext/">
            access control tool</a>. Simply login with the data access account details which we emailed you when curation was completed,
            double-click at the private experiment that you would like release date changed, and follow on-screen instructions. You would normally have used these account details to log in to the ArrayExpress website and view your private experiment(s). Don't worry if you have forgotten the username and/or password, you can <a href="how_to_search.html#Login">retrieve login details</a> using your submitter's email address and the experiment accession number.</p>
            <p><strong>Sequencing experiment submitters</strong>: Release date still needs to be changed by ArrayExpress cuartors to make sure the sequence read records at the European Nucleotide Archive are kept in sync. Please continue to write to us at <a href="mailto:arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk">arrayexpress@ebi.ac.uk</a> and include the revised release date in YYYY-MM-DD format to avoid ambiguity.</p>

        <a id ="removal"><h3>4. Removal of data from the public domain</h3></a>
        <p>Data may be be made private again in ArrayExpress (removing both web interface and FTP access) in the
            following circumstances</p>
        <ul>
            <li> submitters realise after their experiment or array design
                is made public that they failed to request a change to the release
                date. Note we import data regularly from the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/">Gene Expression Omnibus
                    (GEO)</a> and any data that GEO notify us as being withdrawn will also be
                withdrawn from ArrayExpress.</li>
            <li>data is found to be incorrect e.g. sample annotation or
                sample-data file associations are wrong. The data will be removed from ArrayExpress until the data can be corrected.</li>
            <li> data are found to have been submitted to ArrayExpress
                without the permission of the rightful owner; this is expected to be
                extremely rare and requires formal institutional contact with the
                submitting institution. </li>
        </ul>
        <p> Data is made private again at the next daily update of
            ArrayExpress where possible. As the data will have
            been distributed previously as public, ArrayExpress cannot exercise any
            control on the resultant use of the data by third parties.</p>
        <p>Array designs cannot be made private again if they are linked
            to a public experiment. Array designs will be kept private if they are
            linked only to private experiments.</p>
        <p>Experiments that have been public may be included in the <a href="/gxa">Expression Atlas</a> . If an
            experiment is later made private again in ArrayExpress then it will also be removed from the Atlas.
            However, the Atlas has a monthly, rather daily, release schedule and
            data will be only removed at the next release unless there are
            extenuating circumstances.</p>
        <p>High throughput sequencing read data that is submitted to
            ArrayExpress, but transferred to the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) is
            subject to their <a href="/ena/about/data_availability_policy">data release policies</a>. In general, ENA does not turn a public experiment private again unless there is an exceptional reason. Please also refer to our <a href='uhts_submission.html#HTSDataReleasePolicy'>policy on updating/cancelling a sequencing experiment</a> for more details.</p>
        <p style="text-align: right;"><a href="#top" class="linktotop">Top</a></p>
        <a id="user_accounts"><h3>5. ArrayExpress data access accounts</h3></a>
        <p>Submitters are sent details about their own access accounts and
            those for journal reviewers after a pre-published experiment or array design is
            loaded into the ArrayExpress database. Submitters
            can view all their private experiments and array designs using one
            login. Each reviewer account only gives access to a single experiment or
            array design.</p>
            <p>Please refer to this page on <a href="how_to_search.html#Login">accessing private data</a> on how to use the access accounts, and how to retrieve login details if you've lost them.</p>
